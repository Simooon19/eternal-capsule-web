# Testing & Quality Assurance - Memorial Platform

## Memorial Platform Testing Priority
- **Memorial creation flow**: Test both individual and bulk import workflows
- **NFC integration**: Verify NFC scanning works across devices
- **Image handling**: Test upload, optimization, and display performance
- **Guestbook functionality**: Ensure messages and reactions work properly

## E2E Testing Requirements  
- **Family user journey**: Memorial discovery → guestbook interaction
- **Funeral home workflow**: CSV upload → bulk creation → family handoff
- **Payment flows**: All subscription tiers and upgrade/downgrade scenarios
- **Mobile responsiveness**: Memorial access on phones (primary use case)

## Quality Standards
- **93%+ test pass rate**: Current standard must be maintained
- **Memorial data integrity**: Never lose memorial content or images
- **Performance requirements**: Memorial pages load under 2 seconds
- **Cross-browser compatibility**: Works on all major browsers/devices

## Critical Test Scenarios
- **Funeral day access**: Memorial links must work when families need them most
- **High traffic periods**: Platform stability during memorial sharing
- **Data recovery**: Backup and restore procedures for memorial content
- **Graceful degradation**: Core functionality works even when features fail

Memorial platforms have zero tolerance for data loss or unavailability during emotional moments.
