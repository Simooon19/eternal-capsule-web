# ðŸ¤– CLAUDE.md Context Rules

## When to Read CLAUDE.md

**ALWAYS READ** `CLAUDE.md` when:
- Starting work on a new feature or major change
- User mentions "architecture," "business logic," or "project overview"
- Making changes to core components (auth, payments, database)
- Questions about deployment, infrastructure, or technical decisions
- Working on integrations (Stripe, Sanity, NFC, etc.)
- User asks "analyze the project" or similar comprehensive requests

**OPTIONAL READ** `CLAUDE.md` when:
- Making minor UI tweaks or bug fixes
- Working on single components that don't affect architecture
- Simple content updates or documentation fixes
- Quick questions about existing code

**NEVER READ** `CLAUDE.md` for:
- Typo fixes or minor text changes
- Simple debugging of specific errors
- General programming questions unrelated to this project

## When to Update CLAUDE.md

**UPDATE** `CLAUDE.md` when:
- Business strategy changes (confirmed in this session)
- New integrations or major dependencies added
- Architecture patterns change
- Performance optimizations that affect best practices
- Deployment or infrastructure changes
- New business rules or workflows implemented

**DON'T UPDATE** `CLAUDE.md` for:
- Minor bug fixes
- Small component changes
- Temporary workarounds
- Experimental features (until confirmed permanent)

## Smart Reading Strategy

1. **Check Query Context**: Look for keywords indicating architectural work
2. **Assess Scope**: Is this a minor change or major feature?
3. **Read Selectively**: Only consume CLAUDE.md when genuinely needed
4. **Update Strategically**: Only update when there's lasting impact

This approach balances comprehensive context with efficiency.
