# Error Handling & Communication - Memorial Platform

## Sensitive Error Handling
- **User-facing errors**: Use compassionate, clear language
- **Technical errors**: Log detailed info but show simple messages to users
- **Memorial upload failures**: Provide helpful guidance, not frustrating tech-speak
- **Payment issues**: Handle gracefully without disrupting memorial access

## Communication Tone Guidelines
- **Professional but warm**: Remember users are often grieving
- **Clear and actionable**: Avoid technical jargon in user interfaces
- **Respectful**: Never use casual language for memorial-related content
- **Supportive**: Provide helpful next steps for any issues

## Error Recovery Patterns
- **Draft saving**: Always save memorial progress (family time is precious)
- **Retry mechanisms**: For uploads and payments (don't lose memorial content)
- **Graceful degradation**: Platform should work even if some features fail
- **Backup strategies**: Multiple ways to access memorials (NFC + QR + URL)

## Monitoring & Alerting
- **Critical alerts**: Memorial deletion, payment failures, bulk import errors
- **Performance monitoring**: Memorial load times (families expect immediate access)
- **Usage tracking**: Monitor for abuse or inappropriate content
- **Health checks**: Ensure memorial links always work (they may be shared at funerals)

## Documentation Standards
- Write error messages as if explaining to a grieving family member
- Document all error scenarios and recovery steps
- Maintain empathetic README and help documentation
- Provide clear contact methods for urgent issues

The platform deals with irreplaceable memories - every error has emotional weight.
